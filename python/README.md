# Mise Tasks for Python

Basic python project.

Most mise tasks are just proxying uv right now. I haven't started a new python
project lately, so these are still super basic. Will revisit later.

Despite mostly proxying uv, the advantage of using mise is to define the normal
things that are done in the project. `mise tasks` is a more clear indication of
"what do i need to do here" than `uv help`.
